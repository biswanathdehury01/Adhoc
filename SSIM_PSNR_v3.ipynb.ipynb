        "Interpreting the SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) scores can provide insights into the quality of modified or processed images compared to their original counterparts. Here's how to interpret these scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):\n",
        "\n",
        "The SSIM score ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
        "A score of 1 indicates perfect structural similarity between the two images being compared.\n",
        "As the SSIM score decreases towards 0, the structural similarity between the images decreases, indicating more dissimilarity in terms of luminance, contrast, and structure.\n",
        "A negative SSIM score indicates a significant difference between the images that goes beyond simple structural differences.\n",
        "Common interpretations of SSIM scores:\n",
        "0.75 and above: Excellent similarity, images are very similar.\n",
        "0.6 to 0.75: Good similarity, images are moderately similar.\n",
        "0.3 to 0.6: Fair similarity, images have noticeable differences.\n",
        "Below 0.3: Poor similarity, images are quite dissimilar.\n",
        "PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):\n",
        "\n",
        "The PSNR score is measured in decibels (dB) and typically ranges from 0 to infinity.\n",
        "Higher PSNR values indicate less distortion between the images, implying better image quality.\n",
        "PSNR is particularly sensitive to additive noise and compression artifacts. It might not capture perceptual quality changes well.\n",
        "Common interpretations of PSNR scores:\n",
        "> 40 dB: Excellent quality, very little visible distortion.\n",
        "30 to 40 dB: Good quality, some distortion might be noticeable but acceptable.\n",
        "20 to 30 dB: Fair quality, moderate distortion that might affect image details.\n",
        "< 20 dB: Poor quality, significant distortion, and visible artifacts.\n",
        "It's important to note that both SSIM and PSNR have limitations. They might not correlate perfectly with human perception of image quality, especially for complex modifications. For example, they might not consider color changes, semantic meaning, or specific perceptual features. Therefore, while these metrics provide useful quantitative insights, visual inspection and subjective assessment by human observers are also crucial when evaluating image quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, context matters. The acceptable level of quality can vary depending on the application. What's considered \"acceptable\" might differ between medical imaging, surveillance, entertainment, and other domains. It's often a good practice to use these metrics in combination with other evaluation techniques and to involve human observers in quality assessment whenever possible.\n",
